This is a branch of the bootstrap responsive theme for Croogo that implements X-editable into the views.

In order to enable the views, the Croogo plugin's view under app>>Plugin>>Croogo>>views>>layout>>admin.ctp (1.5.7) needts to be changed.

In addition, the files under webroot should also be housed in Croogo's Plugin webroot folder.

Plans to fix this work around are hopeful but not on a horizon.

The bake templates have also been updated and if you look for github.com/djstearns's Project Plugin, any plugin generated will use X-editable views.
